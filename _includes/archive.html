    <p>I am a PhD candidate in biosciences at Universidad de La Sabana in Colombia. 
      I am advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com.co/citations?user=FFtAzBwAAAAJ&hl=en">Luis Fernando Giraldo</a> 
      in the adult medicine group and by <a href="https://pure.urosario.edu.co/en/persons/oscar-julian-perdomo-charry-3">Oscar Julián Perdomo</a> 
      in the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at Universidad del Rosario. I also develop my 
      research in the Research Direction of Fundación Clínica Shaio in Colombia, where I support other 
      projects related to the application of AI algorithms for cardiovascular data analysis and data 
      processing from hardware devices.

     <p>My primary interests are in the application of artificial intelligence in hardware devices for the analysis 
      of physiological variables of the cardiorespiratory system. In particular, I explore alternatives to implement 
      intelligent algorithms to feedback medical devices that align with the concept of personalized medicine. 
      My goal is to develop a diaphragm electrical stimulation system controlled by chemical respiration variables,
      which uses AI to modulate the electrical pulses and provide the patient with a more physiological ventilatory support.
