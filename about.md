## About me

<img src="assets/me_2.2.png">

I am a PhD candidate in Biosciences of the Universidad de La Sabana in Colombia. I am advised by [Luis Fernando Giraldo](https://scholar.google.com.co/citations?user=FFtAzBwAAAAJ&hl=en) in the adult medicine group and by [Oscar Julián Perdomo](https://pure.urosario.edu.co/en/persons/oscar-julian-perdomo-charry-3)  the School of Medicine and Health Sciences of the Universidad del Rosario. I also develop my research at the Research Direction of the Shaio Clinic Foundation in Colombia, where I support other projects related to the application of AI algorithms for cardiovascular data analysis and data processing from hardware devices.

My primary interests are in the application of artificial intelligence in hardware devices for the analysis of physiological variables of the cardiorespiratory system. In particular, I explore alternatives to implement intelligent algorithms to feedback medical devices align with the concept of personalized medicine. My goal is to develop a diaphragm electrical stimulation system controlled by chemical respiration variables, which uses AI to modulate the electrical pulses and provide the patient with a more physiological ventilatory support.
